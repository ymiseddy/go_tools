# Tools for Go

## Purpose

This is a collection of reusable tools and algorithms in go.  This repository
contains multiple small packages usually because these are small enough not to
justify having their own repository.

- [IdHash](idhash/README.md) - hash/verify using the argon2id hashing algorithm
- [Algorithms](algorithms/README.md) - data structures and algorithms
